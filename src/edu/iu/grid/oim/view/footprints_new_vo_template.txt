Thank you for registering the ##VO_NAME## Virtual Organization. By completing the VO Registration form you have started the approval process to have your VO added to the OSG.  This process should take approximately 7 business days to complete.

Your VO will be presented for approval to the OSG Council on the first Thursday after it is submitted and then sent to the next Operations Workgroup for discussion on the next Monday.
