Thank you for registering the ##RESOURCE_NAME## Resource. By completing the resource registration form you have started the approval process to have your resource added to the OSG Resource Structure.

As a registered OSG resource you should have a representative attend the weekly OSG Operations Meeting to review issues facing your site and the OSG community.

To become an OSG resource and be added to the central infrastructure you should attend the next OSG Operations Meeting. At this time you will be asked to introduce your resource and describe your capabilities to the OSG Community. At this time you will also be asked to comment on any issues your resource has had during installation, configuration, or startup.

The GOC will also do some preliminary testing of the resource and bring any resulting issues to the meeting.

The meetings are every Monday at 1:00pm EST. Please attend this meeting following your registration to allow prompt addition of your resource to OSG.
